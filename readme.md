# What is it?

It is a simple ASP.NET backend service that provides endpoints for
- managing sensors that are attached to plants
- writing and reading measurements (plant soil humidity) by those sensors

# Setup
- Run `docker-compose up`
- Wait for the service to be up and reachable at `localhost:8080` (unless you changed ports)
- Open `localhost:8080/swagger` to see all endpoints
- Test endpoints
